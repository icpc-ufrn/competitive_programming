# Probability

#### Equiprobable subsets of same size on uniform distribution
Given a set of numbers from which we are sampling (with or without replacement), subsets with the same amount of different elements are all equally probable.
That is, given that we are interested in subsets of size `k` while sampling, the probability of accessing any of these is: `1 / Choose(n, k)`.

#### Expected number of trials until success
If probability of success is `p`, the expected number of trials until success is `1/p`.
