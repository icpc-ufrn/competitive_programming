# Probability

#### Equiprobable subsets of same size on uniform distribution
Given a set of numbers from which we are sampling (with or without replacement), subsets with the same amount of different elements are equal.
That is, given that we are interested in subsets of size `k` while sampling, the probability of accessing any of these is: `1 / Choose(n, k)`.
