# Graphs properties

### Functional graphs
Each node has outdegree 1. A connected component contains exactly one cycle (and possibly some chains of nodes leading into the cycle).

### Degrees directed graphs
- If every vertex has outdegree >= 1, the graph has a cycle
- If, for every vertex, indegree = outdegree, the graph is a union of cycles
