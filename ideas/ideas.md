# Ideas
Summary of some ~not so~ frequent ideas

### Automaton + Segtree
Automatons and segtrees can be combined in some ways...

### RMQ query on slinding window
Min/max heap with lazy delete, keep adding while you slide through

### KMP with ordered patterns
...

### Sack with Aho
You can use Sack (union by size) algorithms in the fail-link tree (suffix-link tree) when solving Aho problems

### Argument exchange
When trying to find the optimal order for a greedy...

### Knapsack -biggest subset with bounded cost 
DP where you maintain `A[x]: minimum cost of using x elements` and iterate through elements, minimizing `A[x]` when possible

### Rotation `(x+y,x-y)`
You can transform `(x,y)` into `(x+y,x-y)`. Now, Manhattan distance is Chebyshev distance: `D((x1,y1), (x2,y2)) = max(abs(x1-x2), abs(y1-y2))`
